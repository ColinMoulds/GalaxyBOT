# GalaxyBOT | Start
_Galaxy is a bot for Discord, which is easy to use._
_Let's start with a start-up guide, see you there!_

## _Step one: Checking the ping_
We have to ensure that Galaxy has a good ping for your guild, as *ping & uptime is our highest priority*. You can always check the ping by `&ping` if your ping is higher than 150 ms set your server region to US East / West. If this method still does not work please join the support server by typing `&support-server`.

## _Step two: Roles_
Galaxy needs *3* roles, you'll have to add the following roles:

- Muted: This role is needed for `&mute` command, if you were muted by a moderator, then you'll recieve this role. Otherwise, Galaxy will reply with an error message.
- Mods: This role is needed for the moderator commands you can view them by `&cmds` and search for the Moderators category.
- GalaxyADMIN: This role is needed for Guild Owner commands you can view them by `&cmds` and search for the Guild Owner category.

## _Step three: Checking Galaxy's permissions_
You have to let Galaxy some needed permissions before using galaxy, as a matter of fact galaxy will reply with shit if you do not have the needed permissions:
