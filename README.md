# GalaxyBOT

A multipurpose bot made for Discord.
I'm here to make your Discord easier and reliable!

# Getting started -- The Roles

Lets get started with roles since Galaxy dosent say/or warn if you do not have perms to perform an action we need 3 ROLES which are MainOwner, Moderator, Muted.

# GalaxyADMIN
This role means that it has the ability to erform everything except for bot owner commands, you have to create this role YOURSELF and give it to yourself if your the guild owner! (NOTE: You have to add the perms yourself!)

# Mods
This role has the ability to perform moderation commands but except owner commands ask the owner to create it and then give it to you. (Ask the owner to give you the perms according to him/her)

# Final -- Muted
This role is a regular role nothing but, mutes you if u perform a command or say something the mod, or owner can mute you if you have a naughty behaviour.




# If there's a downtime of the bot please inform the Execs. you can find them here: https://discord.gg/BtpCabm or type &support-server in a guild where Galaxy is there.
