<p><em>Galaxy is a bot for Discord, which is easy to use.</em>
<em>Let’s start with a start-up guide, see you there!</em></p>

<h2 id="step-one-checking-the-ping"><em>Step one: Checking the ping</em></h2>
<p>We have to ensure that Galaxy has a good ping for your guild, as <em>ping &amp; uptime is our highest priority</em>. You can always check the ping by <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;ping</code> if your ping is higher than 150 ms set your server region to US East / West. If this method still does not work please join the support server by typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;support-server</code>.</p>

<h2 id="step-two-roles"><em>Step two: Roles</em></h2>
<p>Galaxy needs <em>3</em> roles, you’ll have to add the following roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Muted: This role is needed for <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;mute</code> command, if you were muted by a moderator, then you’ll recieve this role. Otherwise, Galaxy will reply with an error message.</li>
  <li>Mods: This role is needed for the moderator commands you can view them by <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;cmds</code> and search for the Moderators category.</li>
  <li>GalaxyADMIN: This role is needed for Guild Owner commands you can view them by <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;cmds</code> and search for the Guild Owner category.</li>
</ul>
